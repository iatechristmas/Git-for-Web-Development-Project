Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
    - a block level element such as <div> starts on a new line and always takes up the whole line. an inline element doesn't start on a new line and only takes as much width as it needs.

    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
    - it means that the element is removed from the normal document flow.

    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
    - with block formatting context.

    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
    - <nav>, <p>, and <section> are all block-level elements. <span> and <img> are display inline, and <button> is a display: inline-block element.

    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? 
    - in CSS, all of the elements in the browser are represeneted as a box. All the elements will respect the width given to them with the use of %, since it's based on the size of the element's parent.
